# CookieStore

Sell your tracking cookies for cash!

GDPR and browser initiatives to block tracking cookies have made it harder than ever before for websites to track users as they move across sites. However, this tracking information is critical to targeting advertising and increasing its effectiveness.

If the users' data is so valuable, why aren't the users being paid for it? With CookieStore, they can be!

CookieStore combines
-   an EOSIO smart contract that allows website operators to offer their users cryptocurrency in return for tracking data about their usage of other sites
-   a browser plugin that prompts users to share their data and claim this cryptocurrency.

Initially, we intend to operate this without monetising it, to drive conversation within society about the value of personal data: how much in concrete terms is my personal data worth to a website operator? In future, we might charge the website operator a fee for each transaction.
